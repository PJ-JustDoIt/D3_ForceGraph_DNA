You can read about chromosome structures and diseases associated with chromosomal defects here.

This app shows allelic loss data in chromosome 16 on DNA specimens from a group of patients with a particular form of cancer. 
This visualization helps to identify groups of patients who share the same type of allelic loss markers.
